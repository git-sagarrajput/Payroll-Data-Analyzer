Payroll Data Analysis: Payroll data analytics is the process of using payroll data and applying data analytics to it that allows businesses to understand economic trends and patterns so they can make better decisions.
Payroll processing data is information that is generated from companies conduct on monthly or bi-weekly bases. Payroll processing refers to benefits and payroll administration, and can be used as a key source for important information to fuel strategic insights. Looking at payroll processing data reveals the frequency of payments leaving a company every pay period, and can show when hiring trends are increasing or decreasing. 
Payroll data analysis extends the capability of traditional payroll services by offering a different view into payroll information.
The analysis reveals the frequency of payments, number of payees, and the amounts paid, but does not identify employees on an individual level. With a holistic view of payroll deposit data, from payment to deposit, businesses can discover trends and patterns in the market so they can use them to make better decisions.
